    <blockquote>
      <p>All performers play from the same page of 53 melodic patterns played in
      sequence. …</p>

      <p>Patterns are to be played consecutively with each performer having the
      freedom to determine how many times he or she will repeat each pattern
      before moving on to the next. There is no fixed rule as to the number of
      repetitions a pattern may have, however, since performances normally
      average between 45 minutes and an hour and a half, it can be assumed that
      one would repeat each pattern from somewhere between 45 seconds and a
      minute and a half or longer.</p>

      <p>It is very important that performers listen very carefully to one another
      and this means occasionally to drop out and listen. As an ensemble, it
      is very desirable to play very softly as well as very loudly and to try
      [to do so] together. …</p>

      <p>It is important not to hurry from pattern to pattern but to stay on a
      pattern long enough to interlock with other patterns being played.  As
      the performance progresses, performers should stay within 2 or 3 patterns
      of each other.  It is important not to race too far ahead or to lag too
      far behind. …</p>

      <p><i>inC</i> is ended in this way: when each performer arrives at figure
      #53, he or she stays on it until the entire ensemble has arrived there.
      The group then makes a large crescendo and diminuendo a few times and
      each player drops out as he or she wishes.</p>
